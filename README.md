# HelloSynk

> An open-source, local-first operating system for personal AI agents

HelloSynk is a lightweight layer that gives any LLM persistent memory, reasoning, and the ability to take actions across apps. It runs on-device, stores context in a structured memory graph, and executes "skills" — small modular scripts that connect to services like email, Notion, or calendar.

## Features

- 🧠 **Persistent Memory Graph**: Structured memory system that maintains context across sessions
- 🤖 **Reasoning Engine**: Advanced reasoning capabilities for LLM agents
- 🔌 **Skill System**: Modular, extensible skills that connect to any service
- 💾 **Local-First**: All data stored locally, privacy-focused
- 🛠️ **Developer-Friendly**: Easy-to-use framework for building and publishing skills
- 🏪 **Skill Marketplace**: Discover and install skills from the community
